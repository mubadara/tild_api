 * UsersController (Demo)
 * ---------------
 * This is a demo users controller put together to give
 * you an idea on basic features of leaf. Each block is commented
 * to help you understand exactly what's going on.
 * 
 * Some blocks can be used as alternatives depending on your preference,
 * you can switch to those as you see fit.
 * 
 * Although a demo, it's a real controller and works correctly as is.
 * You can continue your project like this or edit it to match your app.
